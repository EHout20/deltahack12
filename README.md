# ⛏️ MineWatch

**AI-Powered Environmental Monitoring for Abandoned Mines**

MineWatch is a data-driven monitoring platform designed to assess environmental risks posed by abandoned mines across **Canada**. By combining **sensor data, drone analysis, and risk scoring**, MineWatch helps governments and stakeholders prioritize remediation efforts and make informed land-use decisions.



## 🌍 Problem

Abandoned mines leak hazardous chemicals into surrounding environments, causing:

* Water contamination  
* Soil and land degradation  
* Air pollution  
* Damage to local ecosystems  

Traditional inspection methods are **manual, costly, and slow**. Many high-risk sites remain unmonitored for years.



## 💡 Solution

MineWatch automates environmental monitoring by:

* Collecting **real-time sensor data** (water pH, air quality, etc.)  
* Analyzing **drone footage** for leaks, fires, and spills  
* Generating a **risk score** for each mine  
* Visualizing everything through an **interactive map dashboard**  



## 🚀 Key Features

### 🗺️ Interactive Map Dashboard

* Built with **Mapbox**  
* View abandoned mines across Canada  
* Clickable markers to open detailed site dashboards  
* Search functionality to quickly locate mines  

### 📊 Environmental Analytics

* Water quality monitoring (pH levels, contamination indicators)  
* Air quality tracking  
* Video analysis from drones  
* Generated **risk index** per mine
